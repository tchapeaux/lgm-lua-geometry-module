Lua Geometry Module (LGM)
-------------------------

LGM is a module for Lua applications providing a *"good enough"* implementation of basic computational geometry techniques for 2D drawing like **vectors**, **segment intersections** and **distance** computations.

LGM is written in [Moonscript](http://moonscript.org/), a language which compiles to Lua. The generated lua code can be used without constraints in Lua projects.

# Progress

LGM is still in an pre-alpha state, some planned features are:
* Generation of a single Lua module file, which can be easily added to projects via a single `require`
* Testing
